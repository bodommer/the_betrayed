# The Betrayed
## The Story
The times in the Kingdom of Absurdia have become very dark and unhappy, when the righteous ruler, your gladiator, was betrayed by his closest friends
and was replaced as a king by the worst of the citizens - Lord Bruto. He banished your gladiator away and imprisoned his beautiful
lady in the tallest tower of the kingdom. The only way anybody can save the dear lady is by entering the Arena of Absurdia, newly the 
most favourite form of entertainment of the Absurdia citizens, and survive 3 long days in the Arena. It is not easy, but the dear lady
is promised to the man who manages to get through all three rounds alive. Can your gladiator return to the kingdom he was once banished 
from and save his dearest and most loved lady? Let's see!
